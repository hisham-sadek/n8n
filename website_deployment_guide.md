   ```

2. **Deploy to Netlify**:

   - Drag and drop the entire `dist` folder to the Netlify deploy area
   - Your site will be live immediately with a random URL
   - You can customize the domain name in the site settings

3. **Custom Domain** (Optional):
   - In Netlify dashboard, go to Site Settings > Domain Management
   - Add your custom domain and follow the DNS configuration instructions

### Option 2: Vercel

1. **Install Vercel CLI**:
   ```bash
   npm install -g vercel
   ```

2. **Deploy**:
   ```bash
   cd n8n-ai-agents-website
   vercel --prod
   ```

3. **Follow the prompts** to configure your deployment

### Option 3: GitHub Pages

1. **Create a GitHub repository** and push the code:
   ```bash
   cd n8n-ai-agents-website
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/n8n-ai-agents-website.git

   ```

2. **Enable GitHub Pages**:

   - Upload all files from the `dist` folder to your web hosting provider
   - Ensure the files are in the public_html or www directory
